## Extra Credit?
This program should (hopefully) account for delimiters used in stuff like:
```cpp

## References
I used https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/templates-cpp/ to learn about template
classes.

I used http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/ios/noskipws/ to not skip over
whitespace while reading from a file.

I used https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/throw and
https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/error/out_of_range for information on throw
and the out_of_range exception.

I used https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/basic_istream/peek for information
on the peak member function, which I use to look at the following character in a
file.
